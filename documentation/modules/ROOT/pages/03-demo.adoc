In this video you can see a quick demonstration of the solution:

Next, you can learn how to walkthrough this demo.

== Run the demonstration

=== Before getting started
To set up the demo, you will need the following prerequisites:

* A virtual machine running RHEL 9 on any of the VMware platforms. Vsphere, VMware fusion or VMware workstation . We will deploy the database and payment processor here.

* A similar virtual machine running RHEL 9 on OpenShift Virtualization. We will migrate the payment processor here. You can try it for free in the https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/virtualization[Red Hat Developer Sandbox]

* Install podman on both the VMs to run the application containers.

* An OpenShift cluster to deploy the frontend of the application.

=== Installing the demo
Run the following setup scripts in the respective environments:

Hypervisor VM:
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpscodes/solution-pattern-interconnect-virt/refs/heads/main/setup/vmware_setup.sh
----

OpenShift Virtualization:
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpscodes/solution-pattern-interconnect-virt/refs/heads/main/setup/openshift_virt_setup.sh
----

OpenShift cluster:
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpscodes/solution-pattern-interconnect-virt/refs/heads/main/setup/openshift-cluster-setup.sh | bash
----



=== Connecting the services in the OpenShift cluster to the Hypervisor VM with Red Hat Service Interconnect

* The setup scripts have already deployed the frontend in the OpenShift cluster and the database and payment processor in the Hypervisor VM. All these are currently not connected to each other. Let's verify the same by looking at the Patient portal. Open the openshift route of the patient portal frontend deployed in the frontend namespace of the OpenShift cluster. It should look empty without any patient and doctor names.

* First Initialize Red Hat Service Interconnect router in the *OpenShift Cluster*, in the namespace where the front end is running:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
oc project frontend
skupper init --enable-console --enable-flow-collector --console-auth unsecured

[%collapsible]
====
******
Service Interconnect router is the key component for establishing connectivity between sites and is installed in all the sites in the network The Communication across the network happens between the routers. Below are the key functions and attributes of the router:

* Routers establish links with assigned peers
* Determine  shortest path based on message exchange
* Exchange target address updates
* Delivery pattern (anycast, multicast)
* Automatic recovery to failure by re-routing
* Dynamic and stateless

******
====

* Create a secure connection token on the OpenShift cluster. The router in the Hypervisor VM will use this token to establish a secure connection with the OpenShift cluster.

---- 
skupper token create secret_vmware.token
----
+
.[underline]#Learn more about the functions and the attributes of the token#
[%collapsible]
====
******
* Creating a link between two environments(sites)requires explicit permission from the target site. This permission is granted using tokens. A token contains a URL for the target site and a secret key.
* Tokens can be restricted to a chosen number of uses inside a limited time window. By default, tokens allow only one use and expire after 15 minutes.
*In this example, site Openshift cluster wishes to allow Hypervisor VM to create a link. Router in the OpenShift cluster creates a token. The VM then uses the token to create the link.
******
====

* Display the token and copy it in a text editor
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
cat secret_vmware.token
----

* Initialize Service Interconnect router in the *Hypervisor based VM*
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
export SKUPPER_PLATFORM=podman
skupper init
----

* After the router is initialized it will use the token to create the link. First create a file for the token on *Hypervisor VM* and copy the content of the token you copied. 
+ 
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
vi secret_vmware.token
----

* Create the link by running the following command in *Hypervisor VM*
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
---- 
skupper link create secret_vmware.token --name openshift-to-vm
----
+
.[underline]#Learn more about the link#
[%collapsible]
====
******
* Sites use links to form a dedicated network for your application. These links are the basis for site-to-site and service-to-service communication.
* A link is a site-to-site communication channel. Links serve as a transport for application traffic such as connections and requests
* Links are always secured using mutual TLS authentication and encryption.
* Uni directional connectivity is enough to establish a bidirectional link
******
====

* Expose the database and payment processor over the network by running this command in *Hypervisor VM* . The skupper expose command makes this service accessible across the Service Interconnect network.
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
skupper expose host portal-database --address database --port 5432

skupper expose host portal-payments --address payment-processor --port 8080 --protocol http
----


* Create the corresponding virtual service on the *OpenShift Cluster*. The Service Interconnect router will use this virtual service to route the traffic to the Hypervisor VM. The frontend will call this local services to access the database and payment processor without realizing that they are remote services. This makes the remote service really portable. As long as they are exposed using the same service name on the network, the frontend should be able to communicate with them irrespective of where they are deployed.

* Refresh the frontend webpage in the browser and you should now be able to see a list of patients and doctors.

+

* Submit the payment
+

* You should see the payment processed and it shows where the payment has been processed. When we successfully migrate the payment processor, to a VM on OpenShift Virtualization, the field should show **processed at openshift virt**.

=== Connect the OpenShift Cluster (frontend) to the OpenShift Virtualization VM (Database and Payment Processor)
The task now is to gradually migrate all the components from the Hypervisor platform to the OpenShift Virtualization. Below are some conditions to follow while migrating the components.
----
* No downtime during and after the migrations
* No code changes to the front application.

Assume this as the transitioning stage, where we have services running on both the Hypervisor and OpenShift Virtualization, simultaneously. Red Hat Service Interconnect automatically load balances traffic between the two environments. The developers can also control where the majority of the traffic is sent based by assigning costs to the network links.

After thorough testing, the development team concludes that they can now switch 100% of the traffic to the OpenShift Virtualization environment. They could either do this by bringing down the services on the VM or breaking the link between the Hypervisor and OpenShift cluster. This pattern show cases the latter. Once this is done Service Interconnect will automatically detect failure and redirect traffic to the OpenShift Virtualization environment

* Delete the link between the Hypervisor and OpenShift cluster by running this command from the *Hypervisor VM*.
+
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
skupper delete
----

* Go back to the frontend of the patient portal and try to make a payment for any another patient, say Kevin Malone. The processor field should now reflect that that is being processed at the OpenShift Virtualization environment.

This shows that the migration of the services from the Hypervisor to OpenShift Virtualization has been successful, without any disruption to the patient portal. Red Hat Service Interconnect has seamlessly switched the traffic to the OpenShift Virtualization environment, without any additional configuration or changes to the patient portal.
